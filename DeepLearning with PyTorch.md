# Course Outline
In this course, I am going to learn the basics of deep neural networks and how to build various models using PyTorch. 

Introduction to Neural Networks
-
Learn the concepts behind deep learning and how we train deep neural networks with backpropagation.

Talking PyTorch with Soumith Chintala
-
Cezanne Camacho and Soumith Chintala, the creator of PyTorch, chat about the past, present, and future of PyTorch.

Introduction to PyTorch
-
Learn how to build deep neural networks with PyTorch. Build a state-of-the-art model using a pre-trained network that classifies cat and dog images.

Convolutional Neural Networks
-
Here you'll learn about convolutional neural networks, powerful architectures for solving computer vision problems. Build and train an image classifier from scratch to classify dog breeds.

Style Transfer
-
Use a trained network to transfer the style of one image to another image. Implement the style transfer model from Gatys et al.

Recurrent Neural Networks
-
Learn how to use recurrent neural networks to learn from sequences of data such as time series. Build a recurrent network that learns from text and generates new text one character at a time.

Sentiment Prediction with an RNN
-
Build and train a recurrent network that can classify the sentiment of movie reviews.

Deploying PyTorch Models
-
Learn how to use PyTorch's Hybrid Frontend to convert models from Python to C++ for use in production.
